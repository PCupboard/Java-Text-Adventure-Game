# This is the game plan, information of how the game works.

## The Game Idea
The game idea is for the player to have access to multiple "locations" or "areas" where combat and trading can occur.
All areas will be accessible from game start. Combat will take place as a turn-based system (the details of which have not been refined yet).
How the hell does one code different locations

## The Menu
The game should first launch into a menu consisting of a series of buttons
- Start Game
  - This option initializes and starts the game
     
* Load Game
  - This option loads information of your whereabouts on the map, your items and your level.
+ Options
  - This option opens up the option menu and lets you change certain settings.
    
- Quit Game 
  - This option quits the program thus exiting the game
 
## Combat System

## Game Loop
The game is inside a loop which is infinitely looped through unless broken by quitting the game.

theory of game loop:
Main menu --> Start game --> The player goes into the "first" location
